Better late than never: Last Thursday (Jan 31 2013), Oracle released the Mac OS X version of the database instant client version 11.2 (11gR2).

Before there was only a client for version 10.2 available.

Oracle 10.2 was released in 2005, version 11.2 in 09/2009.

I call the Instant Client the _real_ client for Oracle RDBMS, in terms of
what a client really needs (while Oracle calls it the other way
round).  Just the fundamental libraries, a few
binaries, and optional an SDK.  No installer and no Oracle home path.

On an [Oracle blog](https://blogs.oracle.com/opal/entry/os_x_users_11gr2_oracle) 
Christopher Jones asks for feedback in case you use the client.  Oracle 
needs to _justify the resources for the OS X bundle_.

While their company aquisitions mainly seem to be customer-base than technology 
driven decisions, their knowledge on own customers is so limited?

I don't think so - Oracle knows quite well what their customers are using.
Even without market researches or surveys: the Oracle user groups,
conferences, support sites, etc.

Anyway, I wrote Christopher an email telling him I'm happy with the new
client...
