From a couple of other services and repositories we've now switched to
[Redmine](http://www.redmine.org).

Redmine is a web based project management tool you host on your own.

The tool supports all of our requirements and offers integration 
for several version management systems, including our main one: *git*. 

Furthermore it offers plugins to other webservices you already may use.

Documentation and knowledge sharing is one of the main features we were
searching for. Redmine comes with support for the [textile markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_(markup_language) and you can cross-reference many other project objects.

We are quite satisfied with the new solution.

**Many Thanks to the Redmine team!**
