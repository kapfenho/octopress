Did you like [Statistics - Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics) in school/university? Some people (like me) did, some not. However, if you work with IT, sooner or later you need it. Why not having another look on stats?

The [University of California, Berkeley](http://berkeley.edu/) published their course materials for "<a title="Introduction to Data Science - course material" href="http://datascienc.es/schedule/">Introduction to Data Science</a>" on Internet. Nice material, not difficult and well known languages and tools are covered - and it goes without saying you will only use open source stuff...

<a title="Python - Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Phython</a>, <a title="R - Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)">R</a> and databases are used when you subdue big data. HTML, CSS and JavaScript for web programming.

On Mac OS X, BSD and Linux you can install Python and R with favourite package manager. If you prefer GUI here is one for R: <a title="RStudio" href="http://www.rstudio.org/">RStudio</a>.

Have fun with statistics (again)!
