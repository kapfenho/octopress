I missed it.  
I missed it again.  
But - this time was the last time.  
Next year I will be there.  
For sure.

The Chaos Communication Congress, the annual congress of the Chaos
Computer Club.

"Not my department" was the title this time, pushing the event in a
slighty more political direction, after "Behind enemy lines", "We 
come in peace", or "Here be dragons".

You can find the congress archives [here](https://events.ccc.de/congress/).

Since C3 is a hackers and security congress, there might be a good
chance hackers will be around too.  And there is a free and open WLAN...

So be prepared.

The good folks from CCC have compiled a preparation list that's good for
the conference but also good for the rest of the time.

[29C/3 - How to survive](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2012/wiki/How_To_Survive)

It covers the main client operating systems (Linux, BSD, OS X, MS-Windows) telling 
you how to ensure basic security on your system.

_Keep in mind: every system can be hacked.  It just depends on the effort
others are willing to spend..._
