A list of organizations we support. And why we support them.

* [Electronic Frontiers Foundation](https://eff.org) 
They are our voice in creating a better net.

* [Chaos Computer Club](http://www.ccc.de/en/) has been around for a very long time. When I was
getting my first computer they were fighting against the Deutsche
Telekom with their Akustikkoppler.

* [Tor](https://tor.org) helps people around the world to access Internet 
anonymously. Essential if you are living in a repressive
state or under a data retention regime.

* Open source and open standards are essential for information technology
und their users in many ways. 

* [GPGTools.org](https://www.gpgtools.org) brings us the great
  [OpenPGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy) encryption/decryption toolset as integrated, easy-to-use
Mac OS X Cocoa application. We need to bring security to the users,
that's our responsibility. This is getting more and more important.

* [Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org/): _"Our vision is for every person to enjoy all the rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights standards."_

* We don't like software patents. They block innovation.
