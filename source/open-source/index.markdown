## Our statement for open source

### Information shall be free

A huge amount of the knowledge we have, many things we learned, we did with
information published in Internet. *Published in the public and open Internet.*

*We think information shall be free, not goods and services.*

Therefore we publish as much information as possible that may help
others.

### Source code: fork me!

Like with human languages, you improve your programming skills by
reading and writing, and especially by reading good source code.

With sharing your code you help others to improve their skills. On the
other hand others can help you to improve your skills by improving your code.

*Fork me: we share our code at [Github.com](https://github.com/kapfenho).*

### Customers

Our revenue comes mostly from customer projects - customers we like and we 
support.

*We will never publish any customer data or any information that may
harm their business or privacy. Nor will we share this information with
other companies, organizations, or whom ever.*
